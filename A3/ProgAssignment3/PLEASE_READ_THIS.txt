Dear TAs,

Kindly read this before you begin checking our assignment. 
We have completed all three parts of the assignment but when we test them together, they don't work
and instead give a Segmentation Fault without outputting anything. Therefore, to test our files, kindly follow this:

To test part 1 and part 2:

-> Kindly comment out the "getNum" and "test3" functions from the main.c file.
-> Kindly also comment out those lines in the main function in main.c where "test3" is being called.
-> By doing this, you will be able to test our part 1 and part 2 files without any hindrance.

To test part 3:

-> Kindly comment out the functions "test" and "test2" from the main.c file.
-> Kindly also comment out those lines in the main function in main.c where "test_1_2" and "test2" are being called.
-> By doing this, you will be able to test our part 3 without any hindrance.
-> I have also attached a screenshot named 2.png in the assignment folder that shows the result of these steps.
-> You can also check our output by commenting out line 174 in the main.c file.
-> I have also attached a screenshot named 1.png that shows the output of our part 3.
-> Our output is absolutely correct, as per the test3 file, but somehow it gives a Segmentation Fault at the very end and thus 
   does not output anything when tested with other files. That's why we have to test it in this manner.


Thank you!
